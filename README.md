# Star Wars RPG

There can be only one!  Choose your character, and fight until you're the last one standing.

## How To Play

Select an opponent, and fight to the death.  Repeat until you're the only one left.

Choose your opponents wisely, as choosing right will be the key to victory.

Every time you attack, you will level up, increasing the damage you do.

### Stats

Each character has 3 stats:

* HP - How much health the character has. This is visible on the character cards.
* Attack - The base damage a character does.
* Counter - How much the character will do in retaliation when attacked.

Attack and counter are hidden, so you'll have to experiment to find out what they are.
